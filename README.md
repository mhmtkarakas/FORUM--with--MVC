# FORUM PROJECT

This project is a forum built using the MVC technology. Users can post messages to each other, and the application includes a modal that displays how many and which posts each user has sent.

## Technologies Used

<ul>
 <li>MVC Architecture</li>
 <li>Axios for making API calls</li>
 <li>JSON Server for mock API data</li>
 <li>SASS for styling</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and run the following command to start the application:

###  `nmp run server`

then,

### `npm start`

The application should then be available at `http://localhost:3000`.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Usage
